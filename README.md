# Slack notifier for outdated versions of ecs agent on AWS.

Build status for master:
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/parabolic/ecs_agent_version_checker/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/parabolic/ecs_agent_version_checker/tree/master)

This is a projects that lets you check for outdated ecs agents in AWS with using lambda. Currently it only supports reporting to slack. I am using docker to build and run the binary with using alpine linux.

## TODO

- Set auto update of the agent.
- Introduce other methods of notification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you will only need to have docker and docker-compose installed. Make sure you have the latest versions on your machine ( the docker-compose config file has version 3 specified ). Head on to https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ to have docker and docker-compose installed.

### Installing

Before compiling and running the source code you need to set the environment variables that will enable the code to have access to the ecs clusters.
The example file `env_file.example` needs to be copied and the variables filled in with their respective values. After putting the variables inside, copy the file so that it has the name env_file:

```
cp env_file.example env_file
```

In order to compile and run the go binary you only need to execute docker-compose.

```
docker-compose up --build
```
Which will put the binary inside the ./bin folder which can be run on linux systems and can be used as an artiact for deployment.

Running the binary is as simple as doing:
```
./bin/ecs_agent_version_checker
```
